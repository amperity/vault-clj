;; ## Client Protocols

(defprotocol Client
  "General protocol for interacting with Vault."

  (authenticate!
    [client auth-type credentials]
    "Updates the client's internal state by authenticating with the given
    credentials. Possible arguments:

    - `:token \"...\"`
    - `:wrap-token \"...\"`
    - `:userpass {:username \"user\", :password \"hunter2\"}`
    - `:ldap {:username \"LDAP username\", :password \"hunter2\"}`
    - `:app-id {:app \"foo-service-dev\", :user \"...\"}`
    - `:app-role {:role-id \"...\", :secret-id \"...\"}")

  (status
    [client]
    "Returns the health status of the Vault server."))


(defprotocol TokenManager
  "Token management interface supported by the \"token\" auth backend."

  (create-token!
    [client opts]
    "Creates a new token. With no arguments, this creates a child token that
    inherits the policies and settings from the current token. Options passed
    in the map may include:

    - `:id` The ID of the client token. Can only be specified by a root token.
      Otherwise, the token ID is a randomly generated UUID.
    - `:display-name` The display name of the token. Defaults to \"token\".
    - `:meta` Map of string metadata to attach to the token. This will appear
      in the audit logs.
    - `:no-parent` If true and set by a root caller, the token will not have
      the parent token of the caller. This creates a token with no parent.
    - `:policies` Set of policies to issue the token with. This must be a
      subset of the current token's policies, unless it is a root token.
    - `:no-default-policy` If true the default policy will not be contained in
      this token's policy set.
    - `:num-uses` The maximum uses for the given token. This can be used to
      create a one-time-token or limited use token. Defaults to 0, which has no
      limit to the number of uses.
    - `:renewable` Boolean indicating whether the token should be renewable.
    - `:ttl` The TTL period of the token, provided as \"1h\", where hour is the
      largest suffix. If not provided, the token is valid for the default lease
      TTL, or indefinitely if the root policy is used.
    - `:explicit-max-ttl` If set, the token will have an explicit max TTL set
      upon it. This maximum token TTL cannot be changed later, and unlike with
      normal tokens, updates to the system/mount max TTL value will have no
      effect at renewal time -- the token will never be able to be renewed or
      used past the value set at issue time.
    - `:wrap-ttl` Returns a wrapped response with a wrap-token valid for the
      given number of seconds.")

    possible only if there is a lease associated with it.")

    return secret data.")

    extended `:lease-duration` and whether the lease is `:renewable`.")

  (revoke-lease!

  (add-lease-watch
    [client watch-key path watch-fn]
    "Registers a new watch function which will be called whenever the lease for
    the secret at the given path is updated. The `watch-key` must be unique per
    client, and can be used to remove the watch later.

    The watch function will be called with the secret lease information
    whenever the lease-id changes. This can be because the secret was rotated,
    revoked, or expired. In the latter two cases, the function will be called
    with `nil` as the argument.")

  (remove-lease-watch
    [client watch-key]
    "Removes the watch function registered with the given key, if any."))


(defprotocol SecretClient
  "Basic API for listing, reading, and writing secrets."

  (list-secrets
    [client path]
    "List the secrets located under a path.")

  (read-secret
    [client path]
    [client path opts]
    "Reads a secret from a path. Returns the full map of stored secret data if
    the secret exists, or throws an exception if not.

    Additional options may include:

    - `:not-found`
      If the requested path is not found, return this value instead of throwing
      an exception.
    - `:renew`
      Whether or not to renew this secret when the lease is near expiry.
    - `:rotate`
      Whether or not to rotate this secret when the lease is near expiry and
      cannot be renewed.
    - `:force-read`
      Force the secret to be read from the server even if there is a valid lease cached.")

  (write-secret!
    [client path data]
    "Writes secret data to a path. `data` should be a map. Returns a
    boolean indicating whether the write was successful.")

  (delete-secret!
    [client path]
    "Removes secret data from a path. Returns a boolean indicating whether the
    deletion was successful."))


(defprotocol WrappingClient
  "Secret wrapping API for exchanging limited-use tokens for wrapped data."

  (wrap!
    [client data ttl]
    "Wraps the given user data in a single-use wrapping token. The wrap token
    will be valid for `ttl` seconds and a single use.")

  (unwrap!
    [client wrap-token]
