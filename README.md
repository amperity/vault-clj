[![cljdoc lib](https://img.shields.io/badge/cljdoc-lib-blue.svg)](https://cljdoc.org/d/amperity/vault-clj/)

A Clojure library for interacting with the [Vault](https://vaultproject.io/)
secret management system. Most of the non-administrative API is implemented,
including the token authentication backend.

## Installation

Library releases are published on Clojars. To use the latest version with
Leiningen, add the following dependency to your project definition:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/amperity/vault-clj/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/amperity/vault-clj)

## Usage

```clojure
; Pull in the main namespace and the HTTP client implementation:
=> (require '[vault.core :as vault] 'vault.client.http)

=> (def client (vault/new-client "https://vault.example.com"))

=> client
#vault.client.http.HTTPClient
{:api-url "https://vault.example.com",
 :auth #<Atom@5cca1513 nil>
 :lease-timer nil
 :leases #<Atom@640b3e30 {}>}

=> (vault/authenticate! client :app-id {:app "my_app", :user "0000-userid-000"})
; INFO: Successfully authenticated to Vault app-id my_app for policies: my-policy
#vault.client.http.HTTPClient
{:api-url "https://vault.example.com",
 :auth #<Atom@5cca1513 {:client-token "8c807a17-7232-4c48-d7a6-c6a7f76bcccc"}>
 :lease-timer nil
 :leases #<Atom@640b3e30 {}>}

; Pull in the secret engine you wish to use:
=> (require '[vault.secrets.kvv1 :as vault-kvv1])

=> (vault-kvv1/read-secret client "secret/foo/bar")
{:data "baz qux"}
```

In addition to the standard HTTP client, there is a mock client available for
local testing. This can be constructed directly or using `mock` as the URL
scheme passed to the client constructor. The remainder of the URI should either
be `-` for an empty client, or may be a path to an EDN file containing the
secret fixture data.

```clojure
=> (require 'vault.client.mock)

=> (read-string (slurp "dev/secrets.edn"))
{"secret/service/foo/login" {:user "foo", :pass "abc123"}}

=> (def mock-client (vault/new-client "mock:dev/secrets.edn"))

; Pull in the secret engine you wish to use:
=> (require '[vault.secrets.kvv1 :as vault-kvv1])

=> (vault-kvv1/read-secret mock-client "secret/service/foo/login")
{:user "foo", :pass "abc123"}
```

### Usage via babashka

vault-clj is compatible with [babashka](https://babashka.org/)

See `bb.edn` file to get you started. It implements a task that reads a secret from Vault and prints it.

The example uses a token obtained via vault login (see source for github personal token or other auth methods).
```sh
export VAULT_ADDR=your-vault-server-path
export VAULT_AUTH=token
export VAULT_TOKEN=token-value

bb vault-get
```

## Secret Engines
Vault supports many different [secret engines](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/), each with very different
capabilities. For the most part, secret engines behave similar to virtual filesystems, supporting CRUD operations.
Secret engines are very flexible, so please check out the [Vault docs](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/)
for more info.

**You should require these for any operations involving secrets in Vault, preferring them to the basic CRUD operations
exposed in `vault.core`**

### Currently Supported Secret Engines

#### [KV V1](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v1.html)

```clojure
(require '[vault.secrets.kvv1 :as vault-kvv1])
```

#### [KV V2](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v2.html)

```clojure
(require '[vault.secrets.kvv2 :as vault-kvv2])
```

### Adding your own Secret Engines
Custom secret engines can be added without contributing to `vault-clj`, but we appreciate PRs adding support for new
engines!

Most operations on Vault secret engines can break down into some combination of logical CRUD operations that the Vault
clients expose. These CRUD operations are outlined by the `vault.core/SecretEngine` protocol. This allows our mocking
to work out of the box for some operations if engines are written to send Vault API calls through the client, as the
diagram below describes:

## Environment Resolution

In order to abstract away the source of sensitive configuration variables
provided to code, the `vault.env` namespace can be used to bootstrap a Vault
client and resolve a map of config variables to their secret values.

```clojure
=> (require '[vault.env :as venv])

; Construct and authenticate a client from the environment. Looks for
; :vault-addr, :vault-token, :vault-app-id, etc.
=> (def client (venv/config-client {:vault-addr "mock:dev/secrets.edn"}))

=> (venv/load!
     client
     {:foo-user "vault:secret/service/foo/login#user"
      :foo-pass "vault:secret/service/foo/login#pass"
      :bar "direct-value"}
     [:foo-user :foo-pass :bar])
{:foo-user "foo"
 :foo-pass "abc123"
 :bar "direct-value"}
```

## Auth Mount Points

The auth mount point configuration can be used to address any of the
 auth methods under a custom mount point.

```clojure
=> (def client (vault-client (assoc (vault/new-client vault-addr)
                                    :auth-mount-point "auth/mountpath/"
                                    :lease-renewal-window 00
                                    :lease-check-period   00
                                    :lease-check-jitter   00)))
```
