## Usage

**TODO:** rewrite usage instructions


## Local Development

A local development server can be started using the `dev/server` script; this
starts a `vault` development server with a fixed root token. You can source the
`dev/env.sh` script to set the relevant connection variables for using the
`vault` CLI locally.

**TODO:** more local dev instructions
